# Outbound Handlers

`pi-telegram` maps hidden assistant-authored HTML comments to Telegram-native outbound actions.

Normal Telegram-turn replies are intentionally prompt-driven: the agent writes Markdown plus small hidden top-level blocks, and the bridge performs transport after `agent_end`. `telegram_voice` and `telegram_button` are not Pi tools. For local/TUI-initiated work where the user explicitly asks to send something to Telegram, the bridge also exposes direct tools: `telegram_message` for Markdown text and `telegram_attach` for file delivery when no Telegram turn is active. In classic mode, direct local/TUI delivery requires this Pi instance to own `/telegram-connect`; in Threaded Mode, a registered follower may route direct-tool sends through the leader-owned bus transport. If neither condition is true, the tools fail instead of bypassing singleton ownership. Explicit thread delivery uses `chat_id` plus `thread_id`; registered followers default to their assigned thread target. Outbound behavior combines assistant prompt markup, text command-template handlers, registered voice synthesis providers, generated artifacts, direct Telegram tools, and reply delivery. Direct `telegram_message` text is planned through the same reply markup path, so embedded top-level `telegram_button` comments become buttons attached to that text message.

Text handlers use the portable [Command Template Standard](./command-templates.md). Programmatic outbound handlers use `registerTelegramOutboundHandler(kind, handler)`. Voice replies can use configured command-template handlers or the provider API described in [Voice Integration](./voice.md).

## Proactive Public Output

Proactive projection defaults on. With `assistant.proactivePush` omitted or set to `true`, completed public assistant text blocks from local or autonomous Pi work are projected to the instance's authorized Telegram target; set it explicitly to `false` to opt out. A visible intermediate commentary/checkpoint and the final answer become separate Telegram messages in source order; this is not a final-only `agent_end` notification. The bridge consumes normalized Activity `assistant-segment` events, not raw token deltas, reasoning, or tool traffic.

Proactive blocks use `assistant.rendering` independently of voice policy. Rich mode sends native Rich Markdown and HTML mode keeps the established HTML renderer; proactive projection does not synthesize voice or attach queued files merely because Rich rendering is active. The queue revalidates exact target, profile/token transport generation, leader epoch or follower registration generation, and session generation before each send. Telegram-owned turns remain on their ordinary reply path, and `commit-unknown` never permits proactive replay.

## Standard

An outbound handler is selected by `type`. Text replies and assistant markup map to handler types:

| Source | Handler | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Final text | `outboundHandlers[type=text]` | Transform before render |
| `telegram_voice` | Voice pipeline | OGG/Opus `sendVoice` |
| `telegram_button` | Built-in | Attach inline button |

The voice pipeline is detailed below: configured `type: "voice"` handlers first, then programmatic handlers, then registered synthesis providers.

### Single Rich attachment result

When `assistant.rendering` is `"rich"`, a Telegram-originated turn that queues exactly one probe-confirmed PNG/JPEG photo, MP4 video, or MP3 audio file through `telegram_attach` can combine that artifact with the final assistant Markdown in one multipart `sendRichMessage` result. The bridge normalizes the Markdown, adds one `tg://photo`, `tg://video`, or `tg://audio` reference, preserves the triggering-message reply anchor and assigned thread, carries assistant-authored inline buttons, and records the returned message id under the exact local/follower ownership scope.

The optimization is deliberately narrow. HTML rendering, empty final text, multiple files, documents and other unsupported formats, Guest Mode, explicit `telegram_voice`, voice-preferred turns, and OGG/Opus artifacts retain their established text/attachment/voice paths. A known-safe Rich upload rejection falls back to those paths. A `commit-unknown` transport outcome or a nominally successful upload without a verifiable message id never falls back or replays because the first non-idempotent send may already have committed.

This behavior does not generate media or alter voice policy. `telegram_attach` still represents an explicit assistant artifact decision, while `hidden`, `mirror`, and `always` continue to decide voice synthesis independently.

Core assistant output accepts only the Markdown or HTML `InputRichMessage` forms and does not construct explicit block arrays or `InputRichBlockThinking`. Telegram's Thinking block is draft-only and must never become a projection of hidden reasoning or chain-of-thought. Any future use for Activity would require an explicitly public user-visible summary rather than provider reasoning content.

### Guest Mode media boundary

A Guest Mode reply is one `answerGuestQuery` call carrying exactly one `InlineQueryResult`; it is not a normal chat target and cannot receive `sendDocument`/`sendVoice` multipart uploads through sentinel `chatId: 0`. `telegram_attach` therefore admits at most one file during a guest turn and rejects additional files before queue mutation.

Telegram accepts public URLs or existing Telegram `file_id` values for inline media results, but pi-telegram does not publish local artifacts to external hosting. A local guest document, photo, MP3 audio, or OGG/OPUS voice therefore uses a temporary upload to the paired owner's bot chat, extraction of the returned `file_id`, one cached-media guest answer, and best-effort deletion of the staging message. That message can briefly appear or notify the owner. One guest query can carry only one media item, and its answer text must fit the media caption limit rather than a separate full Rich Markdown message.

Configured text handlers provide `template`. A string is one command; an array is ordered composition. Top-level `args` and `defaults` apply to all composed steps unless a step defines private values. The command-template default timeout applies automatically. Use `template: [...]` for composition; the old local `pipe` alias is removed in 0.13.0.

## Text Handler Config

`type: "text"` handlers transform final text replies before native Rich Markdown delivery. The source text is provided on stdin and as `{text}`. Successful non-empty stdout replaces the current text. Empty stdout or handler failure keeps the previous text and records diagnostics.

This is ideal for machine translation, tone normalization, redaction, glossary expansion, compliance footers, or any other final text rewrite that should be configured outside the agent prompt. Text handlers run before native Rich Markdown delivery, so a Markdown reply remains Markdown input to the handler. They also run when the bridge finalizes an already streamed rich preview; in that path Telegram can briefly show a pre-transform preview before the final Rich Message reply replaces it. Inline buttons are built as reply markup: visible button labels pass through the same text handler, while callback data and callback prompts remain unchanged.

Simple machine-translation handler with explicit text placeholder:

```json
{
  "outboundHandlers": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "template": "/path/to/translate --lang {lang=ru} --text \"{text}\""
    }
  ]
}
```

Stdin-based or subagent-backed translation can omit `{text}` from the template because the bridge also provides the source reply on stdin:

```json
{
  "outboundHandlers": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "template": "/path/to/translate-stdin --lang {lang=ru}"
    }
  ]
}
```

A text handler should preserve the full message unless shortening is intentional; for translation prompts, explicitly ask the tool to keep Markdown, line breaks, and details unchanged.

## Voice Delivery Priority

Voice replies use one fallback pipeline:

1. configured `outboundHandlers` with `type: "voice"` in `telegram.json` order
2. programmatic `registerTelegramOutboundHandler("voice", ...)` handlers
3. registered voice synthesis providers from `@ststgc/pi-telegram/voice`

This makes provider extensions a zero-config convenience without overriding explicit operator-owned `telegram.json` handlers. If several synthesis providers are registered, they are tried in registration order; the first provider that returns a valid `.ogg`/`.opus` artifact handles the reply. Returning `undefined` passes to the next provider, while thrown errors or invalid files are recorded before the next fallback is tried.

## Voice Synthesis Provider API

Voice replies can be delivered by synthesis providers registered through `@ststgc/pi-telegram/voice`:

```ts
import { registerTelegramVoiceSynthesisProvider } from "@ststgc/pi-telegram/voice";

const dispose = registerTelegramVoiceSynthesisProvider(
  async (text, options) => {
    const audioPath = await synthesizeToOggOpus(text, options);
    return { audioPath, transcriptText: text };
  },
  { id: "my-extension/tts" },
);
```

Synthesis providers receive the extracted `telegram_voice` text plus optional `lang`/`rate` hints. Stable registrations pass a durable `id`; omitted ids remain a compatibility path for older providers. Providers own translation, TTS, speech rewriting, transcript choice, and OGG/Opus conversion. The bridge validates that the returned file ends in `.ogg` or `.opus`, sends it through Telegram `sendVoice`, and falls back to planned text if delivery fails before any visible text was delivered. Providers run after configured and programmatic voice handlers in the priority chain above.

## Voice Markup

Assistant replies can include a hidden voice block:

```md
Full text answer stays here.

<!-- telegram_voice lang=ru rate=+30%
Text to synthesize as a Telegram voice message.
-->

<!-- telegram_voice lang=ru rate=+30% text="Short spoken companion summary." -->

<!-- telegram_voice: Short spoken companion summary. -->
```

The bridge strips the comment from Telegram text. On `agent_end`, it maps each `telegram_voice` block to a provider call, generates one file per block, and sends each file as an independent Telegram-native voice message. The opening `<!-- telegram_voice` marker must start at column zero on a top-level line outside fenced code, quotes, and lists; otherwise it is rendered as literal Markdown. Body-form comments leave the opening line unclosed until the body-ending `-->`; closed heads can use `text="..."` for explicit one-line spoken text.

## Buttons Markup

Assistant replies can include independent button blocks. The prompt is sent back to Pi when the user taps the button; use the colon shorthand when the prompt should equal the label, `prompt="..."` for one-line prompts, or the body form for multiline prompts:

```md
I can continue.

<!-- telegram_button label=Continue prompt="Continue with the current plan." -->

<!-- telegram_button label="Show risks"
List the main risks first.
-->

<!-- telegram_button: Done -->
```

Rules:

- `telegram_button: Label` creates one independent label-only button row whose prompt equals the label.
- `telegram_button label="Label" prompt="Prompt"` creates one independent button row whose prompt is the `prompt` attribute.
- `telegram_button label="Label"` with a body creates one independent button row whose prompt is the block body.
- The opening `<!-- telegram_button` marker must start at column zero on a top-level line outside fenced code, quotes, lists, and indented examples; otherwise it is literal Markdown.
- Keep the canonical body form as `<!-- telegram_button label="Label"` + body + `-->`; closed heads must use `prompt="..."` or the colon shorthand to create a button.
- Use one block per button; this mirrors HTML's singular element model and avoids a nested button DSL inside comments.
- Button actions are stored in memory with short `callback_data`; Telegram never sees the full prompt in the button payload.

Do not emit JSON button specs, inline comments after visible text, standalone button actions, or tool calls for ordinary Telegram-turn buttons. The agent writes Markdown plus hidden comments; the bridge strips comments and attaches Telegram `reply_markup` after `agent_end`. For local/TUI-originated direct sends, put the same Markdown and `telegram_button` comments in `telegram_message(text)`.

Buttons are built in and do not need a command template because they are pure Telegram reply markup plus callback routing.

## Prompt Contract

The extension injects prompt guidance by context:

- If no bot token is configured, no Telegram bridge suffix is injected.
- For ordinary local/TUI prompts, the agent only sees compact direct-delivery guidance: use `telegram_attach` or `telegram_message` when the user asks to send something to Telegram, and otherwise answer locally as normal.
- For Telegram-originated turns, the prompt carries only minimal mobile/reply/file guidance; agents can call `telegram_help()` for full voice/button/direct-delivery/Threaded Mode/formatting/debug details.
- For Telegram-originated turns, write the full technical answer as normal Markdown.
- Add `telegram_voice` when a Telegram-native voice message is useful; use body text, `text="..."`, or colon shorthand for the text to synthesize. A companion summary is optional, no specific summary format is required.
- Add `telegram_button: ...` when label equals prompt, `telegram_button label="..." prompt="..."` for one-line prompts, or `telegram_button label="..."` with a body for multiline prompts. If the reply contains only button/voice comment blocks, add a short visible marker (for example `Choose one:`) before them so Telegram always has a visible parent message for attachment.
- For ordinary Telegram-turn replies, do not call transport tools for voice or buttons; the bridge owns delivery, while registered voice synthesis providers own TTS and OGG/Opus conversion. For explicit local/TUI direct sends, `telegram_message` may include top-level `telegram_button` comments in its Markdown text because those buttons are attached to that text message.
- Never send buttons without visible parent text. If the answer would contain only hidden comments, add a compact line such as `Choose one:` first.

This keeps the agent focused on semantics, prevents Telegram action syntax from leaking into normal local replies, and lets the bridge handle low-latency Telegram adaptation.
